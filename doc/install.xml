  <title>Installing a machine in Vuizvui</title>

  <para>
    The easiest way to get started is if the machine is already in Vuizvui so
    there is a channel available.
  </para>

  <para>
    You can have a look at
    <link xlink:href="&hydra.base;/jobset/openlab/vuizvui#tabs-channels">the
      list of channels</link>
    to check whether a channel exists for the machine you want to install.
  </para>

  <para>
    So let's say you want to install the machine <literal>labtop</literal> which
    has the channel attribute <literal>channels.machines.labnet.labtop</literal>
  </para>

  <para>
    First you need to add the channel for the
    <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem> user of your current system
    using the following commands:

    <command>
<screen>
nix-channel --add <link
  xlink:href="&hydra.channelbase;/channels.machines.labnet.labtop"/> vuizvui
nix-channel --update
</screen>
    </command>

    Notice the <literal>vuizvui</literal> argument at the end of the first
    command. This makes the channel available as
    <literal>&lt;vuizvui&gt;</literal> in the search path of the current system.
  </para>

  <para>
    For the first installation the <envar>NIX_PATH</envar> isn't correctly set
    and will be set to include the <literal>vuizvui</literal> channel after
    you've switched to the configuration for the first time.
  </para>

  <para>
    Next put the following in your
    <filename>/etc/nixos/configuration.nix</filename>:
  </para>

  <screen><code language="nix">(import &lt;vuizvui/machines&gt; {}).labnet.labtop.config</code></screen>

  <para>
    Of course you need to replace <literal>labnet.labtop</literal> with the
    attribute of your machine.
  </para>

  <para>
    Now in order to do the first build and activation of the configuration, you
    need to issue the following command as root:
  </para>

  <!-- FIXME: This WON'T work because of wrong NIX_PATH and missicg binary
              cache public key! -->
  <screen><command>nixos-rebuild switch</command></screen>
</part>
