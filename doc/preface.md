# What is Vuizvui? {#part-preface}

Vuizvui is a set of NixOS modules and machine configurations that aim to
extend [NixOS][nixos] in a way that fits the needs of the members of the
[OpenLab][openlab] and also serves as a playground for experimental features that
are yet to be included in the official NixOS project once they're well
tested and matured enough.

This means that module options in Vuizvui are subject to change without
retaining backwards-compatibility for configurations outside of the
defined machines.

The name _Vuizvui_ is of Bavarian origins and translates to
“much too much” while on the other hand
_nix_ means “nothing”. Which fits quite well because this
repository is for everything either too complex or not polished/generic
enough to be pushed into [<nixpkgs>][nixpkgs].
