# tep ‚Äî tep emoji picker

`tep` is a simple (maybe even trivial) emoji picker.
It lets you search for emojis using [`bemenu`](https://github.com/Cloudef/bemenu)
and either copy them to your clipboard or print them
to `stdout`.

Its main strength is that the list of emojis is generated
from `emoji-test.txt`, a file provided by
the Unicode Consortium for every emoji version. It describes
what the Unicode Consortium thinks an emoji keyboard looks like.
See [Technical Standard #51](https://unicode.org/reports/tr51/index.html#Data_Files)
for a (pretty unenlightening) description of the emoji data
files.

This way we get a list of emojis associated with their CLDR
short name and their group and subgroup in the keyboard
(e.g. Travel & Transport ‚Üí transport-air).

The list includes the following types of emojis or rather
character sequences:

fully qualified and minimally qualified emojis
: What you would generally consider an emoji: a character
  or sequence of characters that show up as a single emoji
  like ü•∫ and üë©üèø‚Äçü¶∞.

unqualified emojis
: Characters which don't have an
  emoji representation. Usually it is required to use them
  as part of an emoji presentation sequence to force them
  to be rendered as an emoji. Probably will be filtered
  out in the future.

components
: These change other emojis by changing their
  skin tone or hair etc.

## usage

```
tep [copy] [bemenu args]
```

* If `copy` is the first argument, `tep` will copy the emoji
  to clip board, otherwise it will be printed to `stdout`
* any other arguments are passed to `bemenu`.

```
tep copy -l 25 -i
```

Shows you 25 emojis vertically at once and lets you search case
insensitively through it and will copy it to your clipboard
as soon as you hit enter.

## tep-data

`tep-data` is the core component of `tep`. It is a small AWK script
which reads `emoji-test.txt` from `stdin` and converts it to a
searchable and human-readable format for `bemenu`.
To improve performance and to limit run time dependencies,
it is only executed once, at build time.

The output format is not stable, but it's guaranteed that each line starts
with the emoji it describes which is terminated by an ascii space
(`0x20`).

## building / configuration

`tep` is currently built with `nix`. For default settings
run `nix-build -A pkgs.sternenseemann.tep` from the root of this repository.

The derivation can be called with the following optional
arguments to customize its behavior:

* `copy`: command to call to copy the emoji to the clipboard,
  defaults to `wl-copy --trim-newline` for wayland support
* `fromTep`: command to use to extract the emoji from the
  tep data line, defaults to `cut -d' ' -f1`
* `emojiTestTxt`: derivation for `emoji-test.txt` to be used
